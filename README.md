> At this until it gains enough traction and I get an offer as a quant dev

# Backstory

I developed an inclination towards building perfomant systems at my internship
at CPF. As a SWE, I rebuilt their projection engine - a deterministic financial
simulation. This involved questioning fundamental needs such as why was oop
chosen? Do we need Python's Decimal library for our financial arithmetic? Or
does it incur unnecessary overhead? Naturally the competitive and complex nature
of Quant devs excite me, I acknowledge that as of today I lack the technical
skills. Thus this repository facilitates that.

Though I am a CS major, I have picked out a few main topics I intend to focus
on.
