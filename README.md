# Backstory

After building CPF's projection engine under Frontier Team, I developed an
inclination towards exploring topics that dwell into very nettigritty
performance improvements. This repository is for me to continue that enthusiam
and explore into other similar areas, and record my findings. My time at CPF
helped me realise that I am looking for a career path that was more than
building websites in React, the challenge of building complicated systems
intrigue me - even if it were something as simple as finding an alternative
approach to calculating monetary values for higher precision and speed (one task
i worked on whilst at CPF). The complexity and competive nature of Quants excite
me but I acknowledge that as of today my technical skills aren't sufficient just
yet. Thus this repository to facilitate that.
