# Unique Pointer 

Yes, I am aware that this is a common imlpementation asked in interview. But I
am also genuinely curious about how to implement the different smart pointers.
Felt that unique pointers was probably the simplest to attempt... I will also be
taking this time to plan before implementing. 

Taking this opportunity to learn about RAII, move sementics and ownership

## Prereq learning

So I know there's going to be a need for me to be familiar with destructors,
copy constructors and assignment operators. I have heard of rule of 3 and rule
of 5 but never explored into it, so i'll do that now.

[c++ ref rule of 3/5/0](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three.html)

## Approach

I would like to approach this with some kind of test driven development
approach, not because i like TDD but just makes sense to help guide my thought
process.
